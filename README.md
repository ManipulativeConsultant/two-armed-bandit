# Two-Armed-Bandit

Our experiment takes place in the well-studied Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) environment, with
only two arms, with different rewards distributions: 
the right arm has a positive reward mean and a high reward variance, while the left arm has zero reward mean and low variance. 
While this problem
is easily solved with many basic reinforcement learning algorithms, we found that consultant-based
methods like Q-learning show a unique behavior.
